# Select one of the following. It is also possible to specify the target
# option given to cargo: `cargo build --target riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf`
# or `cargo-xbuild --target .cargo/riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf.json`.

# Use cargo-xbuild and full build target customization:
target = ".cargo/riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf.json"

# Use cargo-build, with a linker shell script:
#target = "riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf"
#[target.riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf]
#linker = ".cargo/riscv32-unknown-elf-ld.sh"
